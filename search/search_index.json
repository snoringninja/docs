So, if the weight is 15 and a user has 200 karma, they would give 13 karma. I did not add weight to negative karma, as I am against that. The weight system comes with two options. Weight to divide by Max amount that can be given (prevents outrageous amounts) Give Karma Based on User Karma, Not Post Count One gripe I have with SMF's karma is that it relies on post count when determining if a user is able to give karma. To go around this, I decided that I would rather use a person's karma count to determine whether or not a user is able to give karma. This works just like it sounds and if the option is enabled it ignores the post count option and uses a user's karma count. The message box can be left blank for a default message if a user without enough karma attempts to give another user karma. Setting a message here will be shown in place of the default message. \"Pooled Karma\" \"Pooled\" Karma System: no new karma is ever introduced into the community after the initial karma is set (i.e. giving certain users enough karma to give karma a few times). This new system works in a manner that when a user gives karma, they also lose the amount they give. For example, if I have 200 karma and it\u2019s weighted by 50 I can give four karma. When I decide to give karma, not only I increase the recipients karma by four, but I also lose four karma for a total of 196 following the giving of karma. 2.1 Support Right now, this won't work on 2.1, mostly because 2.1 did away with the karma system; however, there is a modification someone wrote to port the karma system that you can modify to include the changes from this modification.
