This is the official documentation for [niftybot-discord](https://github.com/snoringninja/niftybot-discord)

The provided documentation is intended to be as in depth as possible, detailing things such as:

* Different cogs and their functions, commands, etc
* Bot plugins that are designed to make certain tasks easier or possible
* Bot configuration files
* Anything added later


At this time, this documentation is far from complete, and there aren't any current plans to continue working on it; 
however, if you're feeling generous and wish to contribute, please submit a 
[pull request](https://github.com/snoringninja/niftybot-discord/tree/gh-pages) on the gh-pages branch. 
The code itself is somewhat documented, so if you need to find something, your best bet is looking through the code.
