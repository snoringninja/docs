This mod allows you to set limits on the length of custom titles that users
may have in the system.  Please note that there are two different versions of
this mod, with the differences noted below.

#### There are two different versions of this mod:
* CustomTitleDB
* CustomTitleNoDB

#### CustomTitleDB
When the mod is installed, it will clear out any currently set custom titles so that limits so that the users have to 
re-add them and follow the enforced limit.

#### CustomTitleNoDB
When the mod in installed, don't reset any currently set custom titles.  This technically means there could be custom 
titles longer than the requested limit set by the mod; however, if they try to edit their title after it would have to 
follow the enforced limit.
