Helping Out
---

 We encourage you to look around, and if you find anything that is out of date, missing, or something else, please submit
 a pull request to fix it, but please keep the following in mind:
 * Please do not send pull requests against the gh-pages branch, as that is built automatically
 * Pushing built files (meaning you ran mkdocs build and updated docs/) is fine, but not required (this directory may go away in time)
 * Please detail your push requests as much as possible when you commit
 
 Thanks,  
 The Snoring Ninja Team
