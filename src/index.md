Helping Out
---

 We encourage you to look around, and if you find anything that is out of date, missing, or something else, please submit
 a pull request to fix it. Please do not build anything yourself and push it - we do all of the building on our side as
 needed; instead, please only submit push requests to the src/ directory, in the form of markdown files.  From here we
 will build everything and push.  We may change this process in the future, but for now, this is how we're doing it.  
 
  Thanks,  
 The Snoring Ninja Team
