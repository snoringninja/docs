Welcome to the Snoring Ninja documentation repository, powered by with mkdocs.  

We welcome and encourage all help with writing and maintaining documentation for any of our projects.  With that being said, please keep a few things in mind:

* All updates should be made via markdown files in the src/ directory
* If you build locally using our mkdocs.yml file, that's fine - just please, don't push the docs/ folder then
* Please make sure all commits contain ```[skip ci]``` as the prefix for the commit (to prevent builds, we again prefer to do that)
* Please make sure all pushes contain decent enough commits so we know what you did - we may deny all pull requests that don't have decent documentation via the commit message

We really appreciate and love all support and assistance with maintaining documentation - really, we love you :heart:  
We also understand it's a bit annoying for our pull request process, but please understand it's for the best!

**PLEASE DO NOT BUILD ANYTHING YOURSELF.**   

Thanks,  
Snoring Ninja
