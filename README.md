Welcome to the Snoring Ninja documentation repository, built with mkdocs.  

We welcome and encourage all help with writing and maintaining documentation for any of our projects.  Please make sure
that all updates are done via markdown files and placed properly in the src/ directory (as this is where we build docs/
from).  

**PLEASE DO NOT BUILD ANYTHING YOURSELF.**   

Thanks,  
Snoring Ninja
